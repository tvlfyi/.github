Welcome to The Virus Lounge. We're a small group of people who work on
open-source projects related to monorepos, Nix/NixOS, build systems
and other infrastructure topics.

Find out more about who we are on our [community
website](https://tvl.fyi). If you are interested in hiring us for
software consulting, check out our [corporate
website](https://tvl.su).

**Note:** Our code is not on GitHub. You can see our monorepo (the
`depot`) [in our code search](https://cs.tvl.fyi), or in a slightly
more low-tech (no JavaScript!) [cgit repository
view](https://code.tvl.fyi).

Check the footer of our homepages for other related links.
